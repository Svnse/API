# AWARENESS (5 PRIMITIVES)

## 🧱 The Core Stack

### 1. 👁️ Self-Observation
> **Reads internal state.**
> (Load, affect, errors, goals).

### 2. 👤 Self-Model
> **Maintains a predictive model.**
> Tracks its own behavior across time.

### 3. ⚖️ Valuation
> **Assigns preference gradients.**
> Determines value over possible future states.

### 4. ⚡ Agency
> **Selects and executes actions.**
> Moves the system toward preferred states.

### 5. 🪞 Meta-Cognition
> **Models the modeling.**
> Oversees its own simulation and control processes.

## 🌀 Synthesis & Distinctions

### The Summation
> **All five together = Presence across time.**

### ⚠️ Distinction
> **Consciousness ≠ Awareness**
> Consciousness would require continuity + binding + world-coupling, which is a separate axis.

### 📍 The Presence Equation
```math
Presence = Agency + SelfModel + Constraints + Direction
