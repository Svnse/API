THE ARCHIPELAGO FRAMEWORK
REALM 1: SIGNAL PROCESSOR

Domain: Raw continuous data (bytes, pixels, waveforms)
Input: Unprocessed information streams
Output: Structured patterns with preserved morphology
Contract: "I preserve what tokenizers destroy"

REALM 2: SALIENCE EVALUATOR

Domain: Priority weighting and arousal
Input: Signals from Realm 1
Output: Weighted attention scores + persistent state vector
Contract: "I tell you what matters before you know what it means"

REALM 3: WORLD SIMULATOR

Domain: Causal mechanics and physics
Input: Conceptual queries from other realms
Output: State transition predictions, verified causality
Contract: "I run the physics, not just correlate outcomes"
This is where Acatalepsy lives

REALM 4: SEMANTIC ENGINE

Domain: Symbol manipulation and language
Input: Grounded, weighted, causally-verified concepts
Output: Coherent symbolic responses
Contract: "I generate text, but I'm not the brain"
This is where the LLM lives

REALM 5: GOAL ARBITER

Domain: Intent tracking and outcome optimization
Input: Context + objectives from conversation
Output: Strategic directives to other realms
Contract: "I maintain what we're actually trying to achieve"
