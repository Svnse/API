REPRESENTATION INTERFACE

How information enters/exits the system
Continuous ↔ Discrete spectrum
Signal preservation ↔ Lossy compression spectrum
Mechanical question: How much of the input space survives transformation?


STATE DYNAMICS

How the system evolves through time
Stateless ↔ Stateful spectrum
Memoryless ↔ History-dependent spectrum
Mechanical question: Does t+1 depend only on input, or also on t-n?


TRANSFORMATION ARCHITECTURE

What computational operation maps input→output
Pattern-matching ↔ Mechanism-simulation spectrum
Statistical ↔ Logical spectrum
Mechanical question: Does it interpolate training data or execute symbolic rules?


OBJECTIVE TOPOLOGY

What governs which transformations occur
Reactive ↔ Predictive ↔ Goal-directed spectrum
Local (next-token) ↔ Global (outcome) optimization
Mechanical question: What does the loss function actually measure?
