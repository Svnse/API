STAGE 1: PATTERN RECOGNITION

Human: Letters/phonemes are detected
Mechanical: Input signal is matched against stored templates
Dimension: Match confidence (how strongly does this pattern activate?)

STAGE 2: SEMANTIC ACTIVATION

Human: The concept activates in your mental network
Mechanical: A node in the knowledge graph receives activation energy
Dimension: Activation strength (how much does this concept "light up"?)

STAGE 3: SPREADING ACTIVATION

Human: Related concepts come to mind (fire→heat→danger→water)
Mechanical: Weighted edges propagate activation to connected nodes
Dimension: Network topology (what connects to what, how strongly?)

STAGE 4: PRIORITY WEIGHTING

Human: Your body responds - pupils dilate, attention sharpens
Mechanical: Resource allocation shifts - this concept gets more compute
Dimension: Salience (how much does this matter right now?)

STAGE 5: MEMORY INTEGRATION

Human: Past experiences with fire surface
Mechanical: Episodic records tagged with "fire" are retrieved
Dimension: Temporal depth (how far back in history to search?)

STAGE 6: ACTION PREPARATION

Human: You prepare a response - flee, extinguish, investigate
Mechanical: Output pathways are activated based on context+goal
Dimension: Motor readiness (what behavioral programs are loaded?)
