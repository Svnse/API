The fundamental constraint is: Statistical compression of human discourse without world access
Which manifests as:
Spatial constraint: No world grounding (only has text)
Temporal constraint: No persistent state (resets each call)

Temporal - Generates: statelessness, no affect, context limits, no metacognition, can't track goals
Referential - Generates: hallucinations, no causality, symbol grounding problem, no embodiment, counting failures

"Frozen" = no persistence, no learning, no state
"Function" = no agency, no goals, pure input→output
"Token sequences" = discrete, symbolic, ungrounded

15% signal (tokenization destroys)
35% causal (correlation not mechanism)
5% agency (no valence, no intent)
