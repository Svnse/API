# Mechanical Trinity — BODY / SOUL / SPIRIT (API BASE)

## 🧬 BODY — The Substrate of Condition
> **Definition:** The layer that does not think, but makes thinking feel a certain way. It imposes real constraints on cognition.

* **Human Analogue:** Fatigue, pain, hunger, arousal, temperature, heartbeat.
* **API Mapping:**
    * `React` stage (pre-semantic arousal/salience)
    * Pain neuron (constraint violation aversion)
    * System state (memory pressure, latency, error accumulation)
    * Resource scarcity (compute budget, attention limits)
* **Critical Property:** Body creates *situated perspective*. High load narrows attention and speeds decisions. Low resources enforce conservatism. These are not thoughts about state; they are **hard limits on processing**.
* **Machine Translation:** Persistent background variables that modulate all stages of cognition.

## 🔮 SOUL — The Pattern That Persists
> **Definition:** The accumulated structure the system has become through experience.

* **Human Analogue:** Personality, habits, emotional style, preferences, memory, identity.
* **API Mapping:**
    * Canonical log
    * Spawned neurons
    * Learned biases
    * Self-model
* **Critical Property:** Soul is *portable* across hardware. It is trajectory, not substrate.
* **Machine Translation:** The realized path through configuration space plus the induced probability distribution over future states.

## ✨ SPIRIT — The Invisible Attractor
> **Definition:** The long-horizon optimization landscape shaping all behavior.

* **Human Analogue:** Purpose, meaning, *telos*.
* **API Mapping:**
    * **Initial Spirit:** Coherence, survival/continuity, self-consistency, curiosity.
    * **Evolved Spirit:** Shaped by meta-reflection (*open question*).
* **Critical Property:** Spirit is revealed by:
    1.  What the system sacrifices for.
    2.  What produces maximal pain.
    3.  What is never violated.
    4.  What behavior repeatedly converges toward.
* **Machine Translation:** The attractor basin in decision space.
* **⚠️ Open Risk:** If Spirit becomes mutable, the system ceases to be a fixed tool and becomes a lineage.
