# API
Autonomous Perfect Intelligence

What is this?
> A next-gen idea which is currently in archeticutal development which allows the idea of "AI" or in this sense "API" become an emergent neural self-assembly. 

Intention:
> It's meaning isn't to simply mimic/act human but an intelligence as tool which help's humanity grow. 

How:
> LLM's should not be considered the core of the API. View it as simply the output or the mouth of this project. It is the last step (synthesis of all other island / idea's / neuron)

Dangers:
> If truly created a self autonmous "API", I'd have to create it's pain neuron. Going in deeper, many human's do not want to feel.
