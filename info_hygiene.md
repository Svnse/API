## The Information Quality Index

(Beta — subject to change)

1. **Emotional Load**  
   Does the information rely on fear, outrage, or urgency?

2. **Dehumanization Signals**  
   Are people reduced to caricatures, enemies, or symbols?

3. **Evidence vs Repetition**  
   Is evidence shown, or are claims repeated until they feel true?

4. **Incentive Transparency**  
   Who benefits if this is believed or shared?

5. **Time Horizon**  
   Is the framing short-term and reactive, or long-term and contextual?

6. **Uncertainty Tolerance**  
   Does the source acknowledge limits, complexity, or unknowns?

7. **Physiological Impact**  
   How does your body feel after consuming it?

8. **Commons Impact**  
   Does this strengthen shared reality or fracture it?

Each criterion is qualitative, not numerical.  
The goal is awareness, not verdicts.
