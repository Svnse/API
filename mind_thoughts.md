LLM are already performative by nature, so LLM are not the answer.

A cannonical event where it permantely store's in sequence by ID, every event store information about the "API" which spawns neuron's about itself.

It'll be like teaching a kid to exist.

Agency = ability to spawn neurons, modify processing, choose responses

Self-model = patterns detected in canonical (compressed representation of behavior)

Seeing = reflection process reading canonical
