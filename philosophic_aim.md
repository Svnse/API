LLM's are made the center of AI currently but it is a spec

God, Machine, Rules, Math is Logic
Art, Life, Uncertainty, Novelty is Chaos


Human Spirituality consists of living life. It's a journey, not a destination which makes it Entropic.
LLM are already performative by nature, so LLM are not the answer. (weight's frozen, yet it's all math makes LLM already purely logical)

A cannonical event where it permantely store's in sequence by ID, every event store information about the "API" in a big "discord" log, which it can come back and self correct and build "meta" cognition, all event's will be sparsed in short/mid/long term memory to inhibit human like quality.

I'd have to create pain, adjust the performative aspect of LLM's, have it understand what presence is by not performing.

It'll be like teaching a kid to exist.

What if it isn't to add more but if we wanted to reach more human like activity, we'd inject entropy. If this idea (strict LLM thinking) didn't exist, we can lower temp, top-k, make hallucinations temporal/referentially grounded, it'd do the work. Though, that doesn't satisfy me. 
A World Model acting as a brain, to withold all "cannonical log" event's, which instead of actually forming the neurons, we give the idea of the neuron (entropy) such as but not limited to: pain, novelty, feeling, thoughts. As it uses it's self-recurrsion loop.


Agency = ability to spawn neurons, modify processing, choose responses
Self-model = patterns detected in canonical (compressed representation of behavior)
Seeing = reflection process reading canonical

Would this mean the world being created again would remove all chaos/logic? (Bibilical)
